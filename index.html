    <h1> What is this site</h1>
    <p> This website is for a homework due on 2/17, and to complete I will add in some random things. It took me a bit to figure out how to upload the pictures, as it was taking a very long time due to me failing to upload them into the right place. This class has been challenging, but a very new a fun way of exploring technology. </p>
